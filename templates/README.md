# App Blueprints / Templates

App Blueprints (or Templates) are pre-defined structures and starting points for common types of applications. Agents, particularly Code Generation agents, can use these blueprints to accelerate the app creation process and ensure consistency.

## Structure of a Blueprint

Each blueprint typically resides in its own subdirectory within `templates/` and consists of:

1.  **Manifest File (`template_manifest.json`):**
    A JSON file that describes the blueprint. It should conform to the `AppTemplateManifest` Pydantic model defined in `templates/base_template.py`.
    Key fields include:
    *   `template_id`: A unique identifier for the blueprint.
    *   `template_name`: A human-readable name.
    *   `description`: A brief description.
    *   `supported_app_types`: List of app types this template is suitable for (e.g., "script", "web_app").
    *   `supported_languages_frameworks`: List of technologies.
    *   `placeholder_definitions`: Describes the placeholders used within the template files that agents need to fill.
    *   `entry_point_script`: The conventional name for the main script that will be generated from this template (e.g., `main.py`).

2.  **Template Files:**
    The actual files that make up the blueprint (e.g., `*.py_template`, `*.html_template`). These files contain the boilerplate code and placeholders (e.g., `{{ placeholder_name }}`) that agents will populate.

## Using a Blueprint

1.  An `AppSpecification` can optionally specify a `template_to_use` by its `template_id`.
2.  The `CodeGenAgent` (or a similar agent) would then:
    *   Load the specified blueprint (manifest and template files).
    *   Use the `placeholder_definitions` from the manifest to understand what information it needs to gather or generate.
    *   Fill in the placeholders in the template files with actual values (derived from the `AppSpecification` or generated by other agents).
    *   Save the processed files to the application's output directory.

## Creating a New Blueprint

1.  **Create a Directory:** Add a new subdirectory under `templates/` for your blueprint (e.g., `templates/my_cool_web_app_template/`).
2.  **Write the Manifest:** Create a `template_manifest.json` file in your blueprint's directory. Fill it out according to the `AppTemplateManifest` model.
3.  **Add Template Files:** Create your template files with clear placeholders. Choose a naming convention for placeholders (e.g., `{{ my_placeholder }}`).
4.  **Document Placeholders:** Ensure all placeholders used in your template files are defined in the `placeholder_definitions` section of your manifest.

## Example Blueprint

*   **`simple_script_template/`**:
    *   `template_manifest.json`: Defines a simple Python script.
    *   `script_template.py_template`: A Python script with placeholders for a docstring and a message to print.

This system allows for a flexible and extensible way to manage reusable code structures for app generation.
